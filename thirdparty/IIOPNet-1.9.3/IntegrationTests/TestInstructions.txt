The integration tests test the functionality of IIOP.NET.

Running these tests requires NUnit V2. Before building the tests, you need to 
set the environment variable NUNITV2_HOME to the home directory of NUNIT V2.
If the path contains spaces, you must use quotation marks around the path.

Building the tests:
- call nmake in this directory.

Running the tests:
- check the instructions in the test-directories.

Known Problems
--------------

1. Using .NET Framework 1.1

When using the .NET Framework 1.1, you must configure NUnit 2.0 to use the 
same Framework version. To do so, add the line
  <startup> 
    <supportedRuntime version="v1.1.4322" /> 
  </startup> 
in the files %NUNTIV2_HOME%/bin/nunit-gui.exe.config and 
%NUNTIV2_HOME%/bin/nunit-console.exe.config
