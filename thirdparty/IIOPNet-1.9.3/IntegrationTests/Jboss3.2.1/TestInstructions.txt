For running this integration test, you need NUnit V2.0 or newer and jboss 3.2.1.

Building the test
-----------------

- set JBOSS_HOME to your jboss home directory, e.g. C:\Programme\Jboss3.2.1
- set NUNITV2_HOME to your NUNIT V2.0 home directory, e.g. C:\Programme\NUnitV2
- use nmake to build the application and the integration test

Deploying the test application containing the test beans
--------------------------------------------------------

- use deploy.bat or deployConfig TARGET_CONFIG in the directory TestBeans to deploy the application to Jboss 3.2.1.

Running the test
----------------

- start your jboss 3.2.1 application server. 
  Note: It's important to use java 1.4 for running the jboss server, otherwise some tests may not work correct.

  Running the test with console launcher:
  - change to directory TestClientForJava1.4 (when running JBoss with java1.4)
  - launch LaunchTest.bat
