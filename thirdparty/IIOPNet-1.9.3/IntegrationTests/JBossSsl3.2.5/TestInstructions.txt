Prerequisites
-------------

For running this integration test, you need NUnit V2.0 or newer and jboss 3.2.5.

Building the test
-----------------

- set JBOSS_HOME_3_2_5 to your jboss home directory, e.g. C:\Programme\Jboss3.2.5 and JAVA_HOME to your JDK home directory, e.g. C:\Programme\j2sdk1.4.2_03
- set NUNITV2_HOME to your NUNIT V2.0 home directory, e.g. C:\Programme\NUnitV2
- use nmake setup to first create the jboss configuration and create/install certificates (only needed once)
- use nmake to build the application and the integration test

Deploying the test application containing the test beans
--------------------------------------------------------

- use deploy.bat in the directory TestBeans to deploy the application to Jboss 3.2.5.

Running the test
----------------

- start your jboss 3.2.5 application server. (use nmake start-server)
  Note: It's important to use java 1.4 for running the jboss server, otherwise some tests may not work correct.

- The test can be run using the NUnit GUI or the NUnit Console runner
  Running the test with console launcher:
  - change to directory TestClientForJava1.4 (when running JBoss with java1.4)
  - launch LaunchTest.bat
